🧃 Coder Vending Machine

A Java-based command-line vending machine application that simulates real-world vending machine functionality, including inventory management, purchasing flow, balance tracking, and audit logging.

This is a similar project I completed during the first section of the Tech Elevator bootcamp, focused on strengthening core Java and object-oriented programming fundamentals.
